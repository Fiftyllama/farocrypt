FARO CIPHER LICENSE
==================

Do whatever you want. 
Copy it on physical media and burn it, change it and use it to take over the world, 
break it with hammers, fix it so you can arrest people, sell it for drugs, use it to arrest people with hammers,
it's your problem now. Don't blame me if it sets your cat on fire.

If you're a lawyer and sad: consider this covered by the WTFPL v2.
